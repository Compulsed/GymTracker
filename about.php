              <p>
                Over time when we're training we sometimes forget what we once were or how much work we've really put in. We
                want to know, track and record all of those hard days at the gym, giving us a sense of our progress and 
                the little sucesses we've had a long the way. 
              </p>


              <p style="margin-top: 30px;">
                Ever wondered how many times you've done an exercise?
              </p>

              <p>
                Or maybe if a particular exercise is working?
              </p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
                Or even how much you've improved over the past year?
              </p>
              
              <p>
                We keep track of your progress, giving you the tools to help you decide if what you're doing is working 
                for you and how well it's working. For example, we keep track of your previous weeks weight, and notes 
                you might make to improve the way you execute your exercises so that you can view them next time, right when you 
                need them.
              </p>


              <p>
                What you do with your data is your choice, we just store it for you for and long as you want, we'll 
                even give it back.
              </p>

              <p>
                  For a great, free way of recording and tracking your amazing efforts.
